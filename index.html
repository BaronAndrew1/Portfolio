      <h3>Front End Developer</h3>
      <p>I am a Front End Developer with knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and AngularJS.</p>  <p>I am looking for an environment to further my skills as well as work my way to full stack.</p>  <p>In my off time, I can often be found cuddling with the largest dog I can find, exercising in one fashion or another, playing computer games, or a combination of those three.</p>

          <h3>Memory Game</h3>
          <p>This was the first assignment at The Iron Yard which pushed us to apply JavaScript.  We came back to this assignment quite a few times throughout our time at Iron Yard, each time adding something new.  The final version includes a life counter, a timer, and randomized card placement.</p>

          <h3>Chess Simulator</h3>
          <p>This was another assignment from The Iron Yard.  This was a pair programming exercise to get us working together and push our current CSS styling.  It really tested our ability to create well formatted grids.  The requirements included being able to play, pause, and step through the catalan opening, which is quite popular in the chess community.</p>

          <h3>The Scenery</h3>
          <p>This was our two week capstone project at The Iron Yard.  The project, pitched by a fellow student, was to create a website for live performance.  It allows a standard user to find local live entertainment be it plays, street performances, or even local bands.  The site relies on professionals to sign up, enter their information, and place their performances and showtimes, at which time they can be easily searched via the front page by genre, city, or state.  It is still in a relatively unpolished form, and is still undergoing modifications.  While I was a Front End Developer on this project, the application contains both a Ruby on Rails back end and an AngularJS front end.</p>
